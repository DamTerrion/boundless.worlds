# boundless.worlds

Official repository for the community development of reusable Boundless World Builder nodes.

All node configs in this repository are regularly released with the Boundless World Builder.

## Want To Get Involved?

Boundless' myriad worlds are a community undertaking, and we encourage contributions of all kinds!  You can help out in several ways:

### Ideas

Have an idea for a new biome?  Take a look at [the list of biome ideas](https://github.com/turbulenz/boundless.worlds/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aidea+label%3Abiome); if it already exists, upvote it and leave a comment w/ your own ideas for it.

If you don't see it, [create a new issue](https://github.com/turbulenz/boundless.worlds/issues/new) describing it.  Bonus points if you include images, to help describe it!

The same goes for any other sort of World Builder node: We collect ideas for them all via [this repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/turbulenz/boundless.worlds/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aidea).

### Contributing Configs

Have a config that you'd like to share with the community?  Great!  Give the [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) a quick read, and submit your config via a pull request.

### Issues With Configs

Having trouble with some of the configs?  Maybe they're not behaving as expected?  Or maybe it'd be really nice if they exposed another slider for more control?  [File an issue](https://github.com/turbulenz/boundless.worlds/issues/new) describing what you're running into.

Or, better yet, if you have a fix for the problematic config, make a change and submit it via a pull request.
